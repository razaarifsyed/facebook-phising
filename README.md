 I made this back in 2012. To hack into a Facebook account through the Phising Technique.    

This project was inspired by my "Orkut" phising project which i made back in 2010.(Also uploaded on the github)

First, a link(of login_again.htm) is sent to the victim and he opens it. Thinking its the real fb login page, he enters all the login info. When he clicks on the signin button, instead of being logged into fb, his login details are written on a file named lol.txt. I can access that file from the host website and I have his login credentials now.  

This has 3 files. Which I hosted on a free server.

1. login_again.htm
2. index.php
3. hello.php


login_again.htm was made by first copying the source code of the fb login page. Then modifying it.

index.php has reference to hello.php

hello.php creates a lol.text file. And then writes the username and password to it.
